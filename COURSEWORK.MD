### Why
### The advantages of self-management
1. More proactive

2. More expertise

Few employees leave to join rivals, and even temporary workers are dedicated to the organization.

3. More flexible

Employees respond rapidly, coming together in teams to tackle challenges and to experiment with new ideas.

4. More cooperation

5. Better judgment

Employees are proactive because they have the freedom to act. They are also willing to help colleagues because it increases their reputational capital.

6. More loyal

Backstabbing, politicking, and sycophantic behaviors drop dramatically when employees stop competing for promotions. Few employees leave to join rivals, and even temporary workers are dedicated to the organization.

7. Cost saving

Without a corporate ladder to climb, employees find it difficult to evaluate their progress relative to peers. That can become a handicap when someone wants to switch companies.
